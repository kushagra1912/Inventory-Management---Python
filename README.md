# Inventory-Management---Python

Just a few years ago, record keeping was done manually. 
Data storage and retrieval, both were time consuming and laborious tasks, often leading to various errors. 
With the advent of computers and software programs, the aforementioned tasks have become quite secure and easy.
Any sort of information can be stored, modified or retrieved with in an instant. 
In the present project entitled Pharmaceutical Store Inventory Management, the task of adding, modifying and 
retrieving details of any medicine/products available in a typical pharmacy has been digitized using python with the 
added security and reliability of MySQL. 
The program itself has been structured with well-defined components in such a way that with just a few adjustments 
it can be easily modified for managing the inventory pretty much any business.
